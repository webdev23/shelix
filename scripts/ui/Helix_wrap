# And the scripts hx_wrap and hx_unwrap are going to edit it.
# That is the limit, as it may leads to bugs and may breaks the user config file. 
# The user config may not have the option editor.soft-wrap configured, and in this case this script will fail silently.
# Handling the above case seems uncessary and may lead to troubles.
